## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git?
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
3. Why do we create a branch?
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
7. What is a merge conflict?
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?

1) It's a distributed version control system, it monitors and controls code changes made during development across several people or teams.
2) Git is a program and uses actual commands and Github is like a cloud or folder where we store all of our code to share, show, or edit.
3) We create a branch so that we can make changes to a code and then sent it to the main branch so it can be added in. 
4) Pull request are for you to let others know about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. 
5) The command to switch back from the first and last name would be git branch -M main
6) Git fetch updates your remote branches without merging them, while get merge is joining two or more development histories together. Git pull is fetch from and integrate with another repository or a local branch. 
7) Merge conflicts occur when competing changes are made to the same line of a file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
8) To resolve a merge conflict caused by competing line changes, you must choose which changes to incorporate from the different branches in a new commit.
